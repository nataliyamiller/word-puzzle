-- **DESCRIPTION** --

Word-Puzzle application takes user input and replaces all the vowels with the dash symbol "-" 
creating a word puzzle to solve. Because the resulting word puzzle appears on a new page, 
it makes it hard for another player to guess it. 
The program accepts any input (letters, numbers, special characters). 





-- **EXAMPLE** --

user inputs "Cat is here since 5 am", the program converts this input to a puzzle "C-t is h-r- s-nc- 5 -m". 
Enjoy! :-)






-- **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS** --

-- I tried to check if user's input is a string (wanted to allow only string inputs), however, 
I was not able to find/implement a good solution. I found this method, but not sure how I can 
use it in my program. Help needed :-)

--Method:
try {
int inputNumber = Integer.parseInt(inputString);
} catch (NumberFormatException exc) {
// inputString was a String and not a valid Integer
}
