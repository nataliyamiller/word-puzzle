Main Task
Replace vowels in a string with the dash symbol "-" to create a 
word puzzle to solve. 

1) User needs to enter a string, program verifies that user's input was indeed a string,
 if not, program returns a message prompting the  user to enter a string.
 
Example: user enters "1*2",program outputs a prompting message. 
 
//I was able to test this feature, but it was possibly not a good one. Then I was not able to find the correct syntax (or how to use that syntax) to check if user input is a string. PLEASE HELP. 

2) User enters a word,  the program finds all "a" vowels
 and replaces all "a" vowels with a dash symbol.
 
Example: user enters "Cat": the program should output "C-t". 

3) User enters a word, the program relaces all the vowels with the dash symbol regardless of the vowel's letter case.

Example: user enters "Ego": the program should output "-g-".


4) User enters a sentence, the program replaces all the vowels with the dash symbol in that sentence. 

Example: user enters "Hello Odilia": the program should output "H-ll- -d-l--" (just one more test to make sure that program works regardless)

5) User enters a sentence that contains numbers and special characters, the program
excepts the entry and replaces all vowels with the dash symbol (one more final check if the program works with multiple types of inputs).

Example: user enters "Hello Odilia 235*5 years": program should output "H-ll- -d-l-- 235*5 y--rs".
