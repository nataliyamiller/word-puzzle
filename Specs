Main Task
Replace vowels in a string with the dash symbol "-" to create a 
word puzzle to solve. 

1) User needs to enter a string, program verifies that user's input was indeed a string,
 if not, program returns a message prompting the  user to enter a string.
 
Example: user enters "1*2",program outputs a prompting message. 
 
//I was able to test this feature, but it was possibly not a good one. Then I was not able to find the correct syntax (or how to use that syntax) to check if user input is a string. PLEASE HELP. 

2) User enters a word,  the program finds all "a" vowels
 and replaces all "a" vowels with a dash symbol.
 
Example: user enters "Cat": the program should output "C-t". 

3) User enters a word, the program relaces all the vowels with the dash symbol regardless of the vowel's letter case.

Example: user enters "Ego": the program should output "-g-".
